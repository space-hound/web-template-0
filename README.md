With this I started learning HTML/CSS. Unfortunately I didn't have time to finish it all, but somewhere  at 90% of it, and later I forgot about it. It took more time to search on google about CSS related stuff, than actually writing the code.

It's a really good exercise to translate something from `.psd` or `.png` into HTML/CSS to get you started.
